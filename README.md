# Fake News Detection Project

## Description
This project tackles the critical issue of fake news detection in online articles. The primary objective is to develop a classification model that accurately distinguishes between reliable and unreliable news articles. [cite: 2] The approach involves collecting a dataset of news articles, preprocessing the text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, extracting relevant features, and training machine learning models. [cite: 2] We employed several models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to identify patterns indicative of fake news. [cite: 3] The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model in classifying news articles with a high degree of accuracy. [cite: 4]

## Problem Statement
This project addresses the pervasive issue of fake news online by developing an automated system for URL analysis and advanced Natural Language Processing. The core problem is the binary classification of news articles as either reliable or unreliable. [cite: 1] Successfully tackling this challenge empowers users to critically evaluate online information, combats the spread of misinformation, and contributes to a more informed digital environment. This classification capability has significant societal benefits in fostering trust and enabling sound decision-making. [cite: 1]

## Objectives
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for accurate classification of news articles as reliable or unreliable. [cite: 4] The primary output will be a binary classification for given article URLs. [cite: 5] Key objectives include achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall in fake news detection. [cite: 6] Ultimately, this work contributes to mitigating misinformation and enhancing trust in online information. [cite: 7]

2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data. [cite: 8]
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data to find patterns and insights. [cite: 8]
4.  **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features from the text. [cite: 8]
5.  **Model Building**: Training machine learning models. [cite: 8]
6.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models. [cite: 8]
7.  **Deployment**: Making the model accessible for predictions. [cite: 8]

*(Refer to the flowchart in the document for a visual representation of the workflow.)* [cite: 8]

## Dataset Description
* **Source**: Kaggle
* **Type**: Public
* **Size and structure**: 101 rows / 2 columns (initially, this seems to be a placeholder or a subset, as the code later combines data).

## Data Preprocessing
1.  **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were addressed by removing articles with excessive missing data and imputing missing numerical features using the mean or median. During web scraping, if crucial article content was absent, the scrape was discarded to maintain data integrity. [cite: 9] This ensures the model trains on complete and reliable information. [cite: 10]
2.  **Removing Duplicates**: Exact duplicate articles within the training dataset were identified and removed using pandas to prevent redundancy. [cite: 11] To optimize application performance, duplicate URL submissions will be handled via caching or prevention mechanisms. [cite: 11]
3.  **Handling Outliers**: Outliers in the training data were detected through statistical analysis and visual exploration. Removal or transformation techniques were applied to mitigate their impact. [cite: 13] For scraped data, robust practices and error handling were employed. [cite: 13]
4.  **Feature Encoding and Scaling**: The target variable ("reliable"/"unreliable") was label-encoded, and nominal categorical features (e.g., article source) were one-hot encoded. [cite: 14] Numerical features were normalized or standardized as needed to ensure consistent scaling and improve model performance. [cite: 15]
5.  **Text Cleaning**: The `clean_text` function standardizes text by:
    * Lowercasing. [cite: 26, 58]
    * Removing URLs, mentions, and hashtags. [cite: 26, 58]
    * Removing punctuation. [cite: 26, 58]
    * Removing numbers. [cite: 26, 58]
    * Stripping leading/trailing whitespace. [cite: 58]

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Feature: label (target variable)**
    * **Plot**: Countplot
    * **Explanation**: Shows class distribution (reliable/unreliable). [cite: 16]
    * **Insight**: Reveals class balance/imbalance, impacting model evaluation. [cite: 16]
* **Feature: article length**
    * **Plot**: Histogram, Boxplot
    * **Explanation**: Shows distribution and outliers of article lengths. [cite: 17]
    * **Insight**: Potential length differences between reliable/unreliable articles; outlier handling. [cite: 18]
* **Feature: source**
    * **Plot**: Countplot, Bar chart
    * **Explanation**: Shows article count per news source. [cite: 19]
    * **Insight**: Source influence on reliability; data sufficiency per source. [cite: 19]
* **Feature: sentiment score**
    * **Plot**: Histogram, Boxplot
    * **Explanation**: Shows distribution and outliers of sentiment scores. [cite: 20]
    * **Insight**: Sentiment tendencies of reliable/unreliable articles. [cite: 20]

    * **Plot**: Scatter plot
    * **Explanation**: Shows relationship between article length and sentiment. [cite: 21]
    * **Insight**: Correlation between length and sentiment. [cite: 21]

## Feature Engineering
* **New Feature Creation**: The code employs TF-IDF vectorization to generate new numerical features from the 'clean_text' column. Each word becomes a feature, with its TF-IDF score representing its importance. This transforms the text into a machine-readable format, capturing word relevance for classification. [cite: 22]
* **Feature Selection**:
    * The code implicitly reduces features using TfidfVectorizer parameters:
        * `stop_words='english'` removes common, less informative words. [cite: 23, 59]
        * `max_df=0.7` ignores words appearing in over 70% of documents. [cite: 24, 59]
    * Initial column selection (`df[['title', 'text']]`) also acts as feature selection. [cite: 25]
* **Transformation Techniques**:
    * Text is cleaned using the `clean_text` function. [cite: 26]
    * Cleaned text is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF with `TfidfVectorizer`. [cite: 27, 59]
* **Impact of Features on Model**:
    * Text cleaning ensures consistency and focuses the model on relevant words, improving generalization. [cite: 29]
    * TfidfVectorizer transforms cleaned text into numerical TF-IDF vectors, which models require. [cite: 30] TF-IDF weighs word importance, giving more weight to discriminative terms. [cite: 31]
    * These techniques create a structured, numerical representation that allows the Logistic Regression model to effectively learn from text data, reducing noise and highlighting important words to better distinguish between fake and real news. [cite: 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]

## Model Building
* **Models Tried**:
    * Logistic Regression (Baseline) [cite: 37]
    * (Random Forest was mentioned in the abstract [cite: 3] but details are primarily for Logistic Regression in the provided text)
* **Explanation of Model Choices**:
    * **Logistic Regression (Baseline)**: Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems, especially with text data. It's a linear model and provides a good starting point for comparison with more complex models, offering interpretability. [cite: 38, 39]
* **Training**: The model is trained using `X_train` (TF-IDF features) and `y_train` (labels). [cite: 60] For the Gradio deployment, the model appears to be trained on the entire combined dataset. [cite: 63]

## Model Evaluation
* **Classification Report (Example)**:
    ```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.10      0.11      0.10        19
           1       0.11      0.10      0.10        21

    accuracy                           0.10        40
   macro avg       0.10      0.10      0.10        40
weighted avg       0.10      0.10      0.10        40
    ```
    *(Note: The classification report shown in the document has very low scores, suggesting it might be from an initial run or with placeholder data. The report is identical in both Model Building and Model Evaluation sections.)* [cite: 40, 42]

* **Confusion Matrix**: A heatmap of the confusion matrix is generated to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. [cite: 43, 61]

## Deployment
* **Deployment Method**: Gradio Interface [cite: 44]
* **Public Link**: `https://4c7f664c6f905007d9.gradio.live` (This link might be temporary or expired) [cite: 44]
* The Gradio app provides a text box to enter news text and outputs whether it's "Fake News" or "Real News". [cite: 45, 64, 65]

## Output / Screenshot
*(The document includes a screenshot of the Gradio interface.)* [cite: 45]

**Sample Prediction:**
* **Input (`news_text`)**: "By now, everyone knows that disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has flipped on Donald Trump. Of course, the good folks at Saturday Night Live, who have been mocking Trump relentlessly, couldn t resist using this to needle the notoriously thin-skinned, sorry excuse for a president. It also helps that we are in the midst of the holiday season, which enabled SNL to use a seasonal classic, A Christmas Carol, to poke fun at Trump. Alec Baldwin took up the mantle to play Trump again, who is visited by a fictional Michael Flynn (Mikey Day) in chains, and seems positively terrified of the Ghost of Michael Flynn, who appears to tell Trump, it s time to come clean for the good of the country. After that, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future line up to torture Trump in the Oval Office. The Ghost of Christmas Past is fired NBC host Billy Bush (Alex Moffat), of Trump s infamous grab em by the pussy tape. Then it was time for a shirtless Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennet) to arrive, to remind Trump of the fact that he wouldn t be president without help from the Russian government, and that he s about to have all of their efforts be for naught. The Ghost of Christmas Future is the best of all, with a positively wickedly delicious version of Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, who gleefully says to Trump: You Donald, have given me the greatest Christmas gift of all! You have no idea how long I ve wanted to say this, lock him up! Lock him up indeed. This entire criminal administration belongs in jail. It will go from Flynn, to Pence, to Trump Jr., and then to Trump himself and then Hillary will really have the last laugh." [cite: 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]
* **Output**: Real News [cite: 56]
